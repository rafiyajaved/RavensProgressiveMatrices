# RavensProgressiveMatrices

Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices (RPM) are a group of tests used to test human intelligence. For each test, the subject is given a matrix of images that are related to each other, with one missing frame. They are supposed to select a response, D, so that it logically completes the final frame in the matrix. The test is supposed to reflect abstract cognitive ability in the test-taker, and requires the subject to be able to identify patterns and relationships between objects. 

In this program, I solve Raven's Progressive Matrices using visual information in the images. 

To run: run RavensProject.py

To add new tests: modify ProblemSet.py
